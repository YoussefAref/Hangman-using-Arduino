# Hangman-using-Arduino
For this script to work it required an arduino kit as it is a external project.
The input is similar to a Hang-man game where the script would randomly pick a word out of 10 and then you would have to guess until you could get the word correctly however you only have 5 turns where if you get more than 5 turns the LCD RGB Backlight would print 'You lose' with also what the word actually was, but if you had won then the opposite would happen where it would print 'You won' with what the word was.
